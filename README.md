# Hi there 👋

## Personal 😎

 This is Tyler Dean, a BSCS major at WSU. Some of my hobbies are video games 🎮, listening to music 🎶 (my favorite band is Linkin Park), and playing the drums 🥁. Also, my name on here comes from the unyielding love I have for my wonderful dog Lenny.  

## Work 💻

- One project that I worked on is one from the past. In my CS1180 class, we had to create a monster dungeon game 👾 as our final project. I had a considerable amount of help to complete it, but it turned out pretty good. I made some updates to this game, mostly to make it look better, and posted the zip file to my Catacomb Crawler game from CS1180 on 12-09-2024. (This program was made in the Java coding laguage using the Visual Studio Code application, so you must have that app to run the game.)

- Two of the zip files I posted on 12-09-2024, are for a game I worked on this semester in my CS1181 class and am proud of. I had significant help on my Simple Brickbreaker game 🧱, as I was and am still a novice programmer. (This program was made in the Java coding laguage using the Visual Studio Code application, so you must have that app to run the game.)
