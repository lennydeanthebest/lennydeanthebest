## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# This is Tyler Dean, a BSCS major at WSU. One project I am working on is a number game I made using java on Visual Studio. This game has the player guess a number ranging from one to ten (changeable), and then the computer does the same. If the numbers match, the player gets a point, otherwise the player loses. I know this is a very basic program but I was mostly using it to review concepts from CS1180. Another project is one I worked on in the past. In my CS1180 class, we had to create a monster dungeon game as our final project. This one took a lot longer, and I had a considerable amount of help to complete it, but it turned out pretty good. I did not mention any projects from classes this semester, because I am not sure what they are yet.
