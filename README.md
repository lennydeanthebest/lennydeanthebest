# Hi there 👋

## Personal

 This is Tyler Dean, a BSCS major at WSU. Some of my hobbies are video games, listening to music (my favorite band is Linkin Park), and playing the drums. Also, my name on here comes from the unyielding love I have for my wonderful dog Lenny.  

## Work

- One project that I worked on is one from the past. In my CS1180 class, we had to create a monster dungeon game as our final project. I had a considerable amount of help to complete it, but it turned out pretty good. I made some updates to this game, mostly to make it look better, and posted the zip file to my Catacomb Crawler game from CS1180 on 12-09-2024. (This program was made in the Java coding laguage using the Visual Studio Code application, so you must have that app to run the game.)

- Two of the zip files I posted on 12-09-2024, are for a game I worked on this semester in my CS1181 class and am proud of. I had significant help on my Simple Brickbreaker game, as I was and am still a novice programmer. (This program was made in the Java coding laguage using the Visual Studio Code application, so you must have that app to run the game.)
